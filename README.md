# DSA-PALMORIA-CASE-STUDY.
This repository contains my final DSA-INCUBATOR project case study of PALMORIA COMPANY.

 Due to a scaldal on PALMORIA COMPANY, some sets of datas containg Employee's details which include Name, Department, Region, Rating and Salary where shared including the bonus mapping for the year.
 with the informations provided i am supposed to analyse the data and report my findings which relates to the gender inequality scandal, this project involved analysing Palmoria's gender distribution, salary structure, compliance and performance-based bonus allocation using Power Bi.

 ## Analysis Carried Out.
         1. Gender Distribution By Region And Department.
Visualized using matrix and bar charts to show the spread of male and female employees across departments and regions.


        # 2. Performance Rating by Gender:

        # 3. Salary Structure and Gender Pay Gap:
Compared average salaries across genders and departments to detect any pay disparities.


       # 4. Minimum Wage Compliance Check:
Verified if employees earn above ₦90,000, the newly mandated threshold, and visualized salary distribution using ₦10,000 bands.


       # 5. Salary Distribution by Region:
Showed how employee salaries are spread across different bands and locations.


       # 6. Bonus Allocation Based on Performance:
Calculated individual bonus amounts using performance ratings and merged bonus rules data. Also determined total pay (salary + bonus) per employee and summarized company-wide payouts by region.
